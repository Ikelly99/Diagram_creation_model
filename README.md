# Diagram_creation_model

## Overview
This project implements a Python-based LangChain model that uses the diagrams package to generate diagrams from natural human language input. The model interprets the user's input, generates an explanation, creates a corresponding diagram image, and packages everything into a Docker container for ease of deployment and usage.

## Features
* Natural Language Processing: Parses human text to understand the desired diagram structure.
* Diagram Generation: Uses the diagrams package to visually represent the requested architecture.
* Explanation Generation: Provides a detailed explanation of the diagram in human-readable format.
* Streamlit frontend: user interaction and output visualization via streamlit
